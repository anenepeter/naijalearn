# Progress: NaijaLearn

## Current Status
The project has completed "Phase 0: Foundation & Setup" and has made significant progress on "Phase 1: Core User Journey - Authentication & Course Discovery (MVP)".

## What Works
- The project requirements and initial development plan have been read and understood.
- The core memory bank documentation structure is established and populated.
- The basic Next.js project structure with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit integration is set up.
- Supabase and Sanity.io projects are created and linked via environment variables.
- A basic GitHub Actions workflow for CI (linting and type-checking) is configured.
- A Git repository is initialized.
- Basic user authentication (signup and login forms integrated with Redux) is implemented.
- Protected routes using Next.js App Router layout are implemented.
- A basic User Profile page is implemented.
- Core Sanity schemas for course content (`category`, `instructor`, `module`, `lesson`, `quiz`, `question`) are defined.
- The Sanity client and GROQ queries (`lib/sanityClient.ts`, `lib/sanityQueries.ts`) are set up.
- The homepage (`app/page.tsx`) and course listing page (`app/courses/page.tsx`) to display courses fetched from Sanity are created.
- A placeholder `CourseCard` component (`components/features/courses/CourseCard.tsx`) is created.
- The Supabase schema for enrollments is set up.
- The detailed course pages (`app/courses/[slug]/page.tsx`) to display individual course information and handle enrollment are created.
- Fetching and displaying user's enrolled courses on the dashboard (`app/(platform)/dashboard/page.tsx`) is implemented.
- The password recovery flow (`app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`, `app/(auth)/update-password/page.tsx`) is implemented.

## What's Left to Build
The remaining tasks include:
- Completing the remaining tasks in "Phase 1: Core User Journey - Authentication & Course Discovery (MVP)":
    - Implement social logins (optional enhancement).
    - Implement avatar upload functionality on the User Profile page (enhancement). (Completed: Created and integrated `AvatarUpload.tsx` component, configured `next.config.js` for image host)
    - Updated the navigation bar to include links for the Dashboard and Profile pages.
    - Fixed TypeScript error in `lib/courseProgress.ts` by adding the missing `courseLessonsQuery` to `lib/sanityQueries.ts`.
    - Updated protected route redirect to `/login`.
    - Added signup and forgotten password links to the login page (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`).
- Implementing "Phase 2: Core E-Learning Mechanics - Consumption & Quizzes":
    - Implement rendering of lesson content (Portable Text, embedded video, downloadable resources).
    - Implement lesson navigation ("Previous," "Next").
    - Implement Progress Tracking functionality (including marking lessons complete, calculating course progress, and displaying progress on the dashboard).
    - Implement Quiz System functionality (including Supabase schema setup for `quiz_attempts`, `QuizPlayer` component, fetching quiz data, storing attempts, and integration with Lesson View Page).
    - Enhance User Dashboard (specifically "Resume Learning" links).
    - Implement quiz consumption logic (displaying questions, handling answers, feedback, score calculation).
- Implementing "Phase 3: NaijaLearn Specific Interactive Features".
- Implementing "Phase 4: Content Management (Admin) & Advanced Features".
- Implementing "Phase 5: Refinement, Testing, Optimization & Deployment".
- Addressing cross-cutting concerns like robust error handling, state management refinement, TypeScript usage, code quality, secrets management, and asynchronous operations need continuous effort throughout all phases.

## Known Issues
- Potential technical challenges related to integrating the various services (Next.js, Supabase, Sanity) and implementing complex interactive components will be addressed as development progresses.
