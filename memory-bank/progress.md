# Progress: NaijaLearn

:start_line:3
-------
## Current Status
The project has completed "Phase 0: Foundation & Setup" and is ready to begin implementing core user journeys. The foundational documentation, environment configuration, basic project structure, and initial CI/CD are in place.

## What Works
- The project requirements and initial development plan have been read and understood.
- The core memory bank documentation structure is established and populated.
- The basic Next.js project structure with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit integration is set up.
- Supabase and Sanity.io projects are created and linked via environment variables.
- A basic GitHub Actions workflow for CI (linting and type-checking) is configured.
- A Git repository is initialized.

## What's Left to Build
The majority of the application development, as outlined in the "NaijaLearn: Development Action Plan", is remaining. This includes:
- **Phase 1:** Implementing user authentication, profiles, course discovery, and initial enrollment logic.
- **Phase 2:** Developing core e-learning mechanics (course consumption, progress tracking, basic quizzes).
- **Phase 3:** Implementing NaijaLearn specific interactive features (Map, Language Tool, Matching Game, Recipe Explorer).
- **Phase 4:** Enhancing Sanity Studio, implementing admin features (optional), and adding advanced user features (social login, password recovery, etc.).
- **Phase 5:** Comprehensive testing, performance optimization, accessibility review, security hardening, and final deployment preparation.
- Cross-cutting concerns like robust error handling, state management refinement, TypeScript usage, code quality, secrets management, and asynchronous operations need continuous effort throughout all phases.

## Known Issues
- The TypeScript error regarding `@supabase/supabase-js` types persists but is expected to resolve once the development server is running or the TS server refreshes.
- Potential technical challenges related to integrating the various services (Next.js, Supabase, Sanity) and implementing complex interactive components will be addressed as development progresses.
