# Active Context: NaijaLearn

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on establishing the foundational technical infrastructure for the NaijaLearn platform. This aligns with "Phase 0: Foundation & Setup" of the development action plan.

## Recent Changes
As the project is just starting, there are no significant code changes yet. The primary recent activity has been reading and internalizing the project requirements document (`naijalearn-prd.md`) and the proposed development action plan (`action\ plan.md`). The core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been created to capture this initial understanding.

## Next Steps
The immediate next steps are to execute the tasks outlined in "Phase 0: Foundation & Setup" of the action plan. This includes:
1. Project Initialization (Next.js, Git, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit setup).
2. Service Setup (Supabase and Sanity.io project creation and initial configuration).
3. Core Project Structure setup.
4. Basic Layout & UI Shell implementation.
5. Initial Deployment & CI/CD setup.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Confirming the use of Tailwind CSS v4 stable features and documenting any necessary workarounds for experimental features.
- Ensuring Supabase RLS is enabled and correctly configured from the outset.
- Setting up environment variables securely in `.env.local` and Vercel.
- Establishing a basic CI pipeline for linting and type-checking.
