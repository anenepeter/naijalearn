# Active Context: NaijaLearn

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on completing "Phase 1: Core User Journey - Authentication & Course Discovery (MVP)" of the development action plan. Significant progress has been made on authentication and course discovery features.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented basic user authentication (signup and login forms integrated with Redux).
- Implemented protected routes using Next.js App Router layout.
- Implemented a basic User Profile page.
- Defined core Sanity schemas for course content (`category`, `instructor`, `module`, `lesson`, `quiz`, `question`).
- Set up the Sanity client and GROQ queries (`lib/sanityClient.ts`, `lib/sanityQueries.ts`).
- Created the homepage (`app/page.tsx`) and course listing page (`app/courses/page.tsx`) to display courses fetched from Sanity.
- Created a placeholder `CourseCard` component (`components/features/courses/CourseCard.tsx`).
- Set up the Supabase schema for enrollments.
- Created the detailed course pages (`app/courses/[slug]/page.tsx`) to display individual course information and handle enrollment.
- Implemented fetching and displaying user's enrolled courses on the dashboard (`app/(platform)/dashboard/page.tsx`).
- Implemented the password recovery flow (`app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`, `app/(auth)/update-password/page.tsx`).

## Next Steps
The immediate next steps are to complete the remaining tasks in "Phase 1: Core User Journey - Authentication & Course Discovery (MVP)". This includes:
- Implement social logins (optional enhancement).
- Implement avatar upload functionality on the User Profile page (enhancement).

After completing Phase 1, the project will move on to "Phase 2: Core E-Learning Mechanics - Consumption & Quizzes".

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring robust error handling and user feedback for all authentication and enrollment processes.
- Continuing to use TypeScript for type safety.
- Addressing any lingering file corruption issues if they reappear.
- Preparing for the implementation of interactive components in later phases.
