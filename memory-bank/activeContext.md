# Active Context: NaijaLearn

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on completing the remaining tasks from Phase 1 (Enhancements): implementing social logins. The avatar upload functionality has been implemented by creating and integrating a dedicated component and configuring Next.js image settings. The navigation bar has been updated, a TypeScript error related to course progress calculation has been fixed, and the protected route redirect and login page links have been updated.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented basic user authentication (signup and login forms integrated with Redux).
- Implemented protected routes using Next.js App Router layout.
- Implemented a basic User Profile page.
- Defined core Sanity schemas for course content (`category`, `instructor`, `module`, `lesson`, `quiz`, `question`).
- Set up the Sanity client and GROQ queries (`lib/sanityClient.ts`, `lib/sanityQueries.ts`).
- Created the homepage (`app/page.tsx`) and course listing page (`app/courses/page.tsx`) to display courses fetched from Sanity.
- Created a placeholder `CourseCard` component (`components/features/courses/CourseCard.tsx`).
- Set up the Supabase schema for enrollments.
- Created the detailed course pages (`app/courses/[slug]/page.tsx`) to display individual course information and handle enrollment.
- Implemented fetching and displaying user's enrolled courses on the dashboard (`app/(platform)/dashboard/page.tsx`).
- Implemented the password recovery flow (`app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`, `app/(auth)/update-password/page.tsx`).
- Implemented the Lesson View Page (`app/courses/[courseSlug]/lessons/[lessonSlug]/page.tsx`).
- Implemented the Course Structure Sidebar component (`components/features/courses/CourseSidebar.tsx`).
- Implemented Progress Tracking functionality (including marking lessons complete, calculating course progress, and displaying progress on the dashboard).
- Implemented Quiz System functionality (including Supabase schema setup for `quiz_attempts`, `QuizPlayer` component, fetching quiz data, storing attempts, and integration with Lesson View Page).
- Enhanced User Dashboard with "Resume Learning" links.
- Implemented avatar upload functionality on the User Profile page, including creating the `AvatarUpload.tsx` component and configuring `next.config.js` for image optimization.
- Updated the navigation bar to include links for the Dashboard and Profile pages.
- Fixed TypeScript error in `lib/courseProgress.ts` by adding the missing `courseLessonsQuery` to `lib/sanityQueries.ts`.
- Updated protected route redirect to `/login`.
- Added signup and forgotten password links to the login page (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`).

## Next Steps
The immediate next steps are to complete the remaining task from Phase 1:
- Implement social logins (optional enhancement).

After completing this remaining Phase 1 enhancement, the project can move on to "Phase 3: NaijaLearn Specific Interactive Features".

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring robust error handling and user feedback for all authentication and enrollment processes.
- Continuing to use TypeScript for type safety.
- Addressing any lingering file corruption issues if they reappear.
- Preparing for the implementation of interactive components in later phases.
