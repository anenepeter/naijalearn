# Product Context: NaijaLearn

## Why this Project Exists
NaijaLearn exists to address the need for an accessible, interactive, and comprehensive digital resource dedicated to educating a global audience about Nigeria's rich cultural heritage. It aims to connect the Nigerian diaspora with their roots, provide academic resources, and serve anyone curious about Nigerian culture.

## Problems it Solves
- Lack of a centralized, comprehensive, and interactive online platform for learning about diverse Nigerian culture (languages, traditions, history, cuisine, arts).
- Difficulty for the Nigerian diaspora and international audiences to access structured cultural education.
- Need for engaging and modern educational tools beyond traditional texts.

## How it Should Work
The platform should function as a user-friendly e-learning site where users can:
- Discover and browse courses on various cultural topics.
- Enroll in courses (initially free).
- Consume structured content (text, video, resources) within lessons and modules.
- Engage with interactive elements like quizzes, a language pronunciation tool, an interactive map, and cultural matching games.
- Track their learning progress via a personalized dashboard.
- Authenticate securely (signup, login, profile management).

Instructors/Admins should be able to:
- Create, manage, and publish all course content, quizzes, and interactive element data via a headless CMS (Sanity.io).

The platform will utilize Next.js 15 (App Router) for the frontend, Tailwind CSS v4 for styling, Redux Toolkit for state management, Supabase for backend (Auth, DB, Storage), and Sanity.io for CMS.

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive & User-Friendly:** Easy navigation and straightforward interactions for all user types.
- **Engaging & Inviting:** Design and content should encourage exploration and appreciation of Nigerian culture.
- **Responsive:** Seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Accessible:** Strive for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Personalized:** Dashboard reflects user's enrolled courses and progress.
- **Modern Aesthetic:** Clean, culturally infused design with smooth transitions and visual feedback.
